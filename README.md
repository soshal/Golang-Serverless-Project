# Golang-Serverless-Project

This project demonstrates a complete serverless stack using AWS services: API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Lambda. The project is implemented in Go and showcases how to build a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient serverless application.

## Features

- **API Gateway**: To expose RESTful endpoints.
- **AWS Lambda**: To handle backend logic.
- **DynamoDB**: As the NoSQL database for storage.
- **Serverless Framework**: To manage and deploy AWS resources.

## Architecture

1. **API Gateway**: Receives HTTP requests and triggers Lambda functions.
2. **Lambda Functions**: Implemented in Go, these functions contain the business logic.
3. **DynamoDB**: Stores and retrieves data.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured
- Go installed
- Serverless Framework installed
